# Movies
Movie Recommendation Project

I will be combining Python and MySQL as Python has many libraries and tools for data analysis and machine learning, and MySQL is a popular and a widely used database management system. I have already used both Python and MySQL for school projects but this will be my first project combining the two for a personal prject.

-----------OUTLINE-----------

Collect and preprocess data: I'll need data about movies, such as their titles, genres, and ratings. I will scrape data from movie websites myself. Once I have the data, I'll clean and preprocess it to remove duplicates, fix errors, and prepare it for analysis.

Build a database: I will use MySQL to create a database to store my movie data, design the database schema, create the tables, and import the preprocessed data.

Train a recommendation model: I will use Python libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow (most likely to use TensorFlow) to train a recommendation model. I can use collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.

Implement the recommendation engine: Once I have trained my model, I can use it to generate recommendations for users based on their viewing history or preferences. I'll use Python to implement the recommendation engine, and connect it to the MySQL database to retrieve data.


-----------WIBNI-----------
Build a user interface: To make the recommendation system accessible to users, I can build a user interface using web frameworks such as Flask or Django. This will allow users to interact with the system, search for movies, and receive recommendations.

Test and deploy the system: Once I have built the recommendation system and user interface, I'll have to test it thoroughly to see that it works properly then deploy the system to a web server or cloud platform so that users can access it.
